There are various major elements that you can use to customize the appearance of your app:

- Splash screen
- Fonts
- Images
- Supporting safe areas
- React Navigation themes
- React Navigation Elements

## Splash screen

Splash screens are required on native platforms. Expo Router automatically manages the splash screen by keeping it visibile until the first route is rendered. This also applies to any of the route that the user deep links into.

By default, the splash screen is hidden when the first route is rendered, which suits most use cases. However, a route may require to continue displaying the splash screen until additional data or asset loading is done. This is achieved by using the `SplashScreen` API from `expo-splash-screen` library. Calling `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` before the splash screen hides, the splash screen will remain visible until the `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` function has been invoked.

To enable this functionality, install `expo-splash-screen` in your project.

## Fonts

Use the `SplashScreen` API in conjunction with `expo-font` to keep the splash screen visible while fonts are loading or to prevent white flash.

### Static Rendering for font loading

Expo Router's [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering) provides [automatic static optimization](/router/reference/static-rendering#fonts) for font loading on web. This enables best practices for working with fonts in the browser.

## Images

Use Expo Image for the best cross-platform experience:

      documentation.

  }

## Supporting safe areas

Expo Router comes with the `react-native-safe-area-context` library installed. This library provides a flexible API for accessing device-safe area inset information for both Android and iOS.

      Safe areas guide.

## React Navigation themes

React Navigation navigators `<Stack>`, `<Drawer>`, and `<Tabs>` use a shared appearance provider. In React Navigation, you set the theme for the entire app using the `<NavigationContainer />` component. Expo Router manages the root container so that you can set the theme using the `ThemeProvider` directly.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
/* @info Import theme APIs from React Navigation directly. */
import { ThemeProvider, DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, useTheme } from '@react-navigation/native';
/* @end */
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    /* @info All layouts inside this provider will use the dark theme. */
    <ThemeProvider value={DarkTheme}>
      /* @end */
      <Slot />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

You can use this technique at any layer of the app to set the theme for a specific layout. The current theme can be accessed with `useTheme` from `@react-navigation/native`.

## React Navigation Elements

The [`@react-navigation/elements`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/elements/) library provides a set of UI elements and helpers that can be used to build a navigation UI. These components are designed to be composable and customizable. You can reuse the default functionality from the library or build your navigator's UI on top of it.

To use it with Expo Router, you need to install the library:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="npm">

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install @react-navigation/elements']} />

</Tab>

<Tab label="Yarn">

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn add @react-navigation/elements']} />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

To learn more about the components and utilities the library provides, see [Elements library](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/elements/) documentation.
